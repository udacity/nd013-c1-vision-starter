# Object detection in an Urban Environment

## Data

For this project, we will be using data from the [Waymo Open dataset](https://waymo.com/open/). The files can be downloaded directly from the website as tar files or from the [Google Cloud Bucket](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/waymo_open_dataset_v_1_2_0_individual_files/) as individual tf records. 

## Structure

The data in the classroom workspace will be organized as follows:
```
/home/backups/
    - raw: contained the tf records in the Waymo Open format. (NOTE: this folder only contains temporary files and should be empty after running the download and process script)

/home/workspace/data/
    - processed: contained the tf records in the Tf Object detection api format. (NOTE: this folder should be empty after creating the splits)
    - test: contain the test data
    - train: contain the train data
    - val: contain the val data
```

The experiments folder will be organized as follow:
```
experiments/
    - exporter_main_v2.py: to create an inference model
    - model_main_tf2.py: to launch training
    - experiment0/....
    - experiment1/....
    - experiment2/...
    - pretrained-models/: contains the checkpoints of the pretrained models.
```

## Prerequisites

### Local Setup

For local setup if you have your own Nvidia GPU, you can use the provided Dockerfile and requirements in the [build directory](./build).

Follow [the README therein](./build/README.md) to create a docker container and install all prerequisites.

### Classroom Workspace

In the classroom workspace, every library and package should already be installed in your environment. However, you will need to login to Google Cloud using the following command:
```
gcloud auth login
```
This command will display a link that you need to copy and paste to your web browser. Follow the instructions. You can check if you are logged correctly by running :
```
gsutil ls gs://waymo_open_dataset_v_1_2_0_individual_files/
```
It should display the content of the bucket.

## Instructions

### Download and process the data

The first goal of this project is to download the data from the Waymo's Google Cloud bucket to your local machine. For this project, we only need a subset of the data provided (for example, we do not need to use the Lidar data). Therefore, we are going to download and trim immediately each file. In `download_process.py`, you will need to implement the `create_tf_example` function. This function takes the components of a Waymo Tf record and save them in the Tf Object Detection api format. An example of such function is described [here](https://tensorflow-object-detection-api-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/training.html#create-tensorflow-records). We are already providing the `label_map.pbtxt` file. 

Once you have coded the function, you can run the script at using
```
python download_process.py --data_dir /home/workspace/data/ --temp_dir /home/backups/
```

You are downloading XX files so be patient! Once the script is done, you can look inside the `/home/workspace/data/processed` folder to see if the files have been downloaded and processed correctly.


### Exploratory Data Analysis

Now that you have downloaded and processed the data, you should explore the dataset! This is the most important task of any machine learning project. To do so, open the `Exploratory Data Analysis` notebook. In this notebook, your first task will be to implement a `display_instances` function to display images and annotations using `matplotlib`. This should be very similar to the function you created during the course. Once you are done, feel free to spend more time exploring the data and report your findings. Report anything relevant about the dataset in the writeup.

Keep in mind that you should refer to this analysis to create the different spits (training, testing and validation). 


### Create the splits

Now you have become one with the data! Congratulations! How will you use this knowledge to create the different splits: training, validation and testing. There are no single answer to this question but you will need to justify your choice in your submission. You will need to implement the `split_data` function in the `create_splits.py` file. Once you have implemented this function, run it using:
```
python create_splits.py --data_dir /home/workspace/data/
```

NOTE: Keep in mind that your storage is limited. The files should be <ins>moved</ins> and not copied. 

### Edit the config file

Now you are ready for training. As we explain during the course, the Tf Object Detection API relies on **config files**. The config that we will use for this project is `pipeline.config`, which is the config for a SSD Resnet 50 640x640 model. You can learn more about the Single Shot Detector [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.02325.pdf). 

First, let's download the [pretrained model](http://download.tensorflow.org/models/object_detection/tf2/20200711/ssd_resnet50_v1_fpn_640x640_coco17_tpu-8.tar.gz) and move it to `training/pretrained-models/`. 

Now we need to edit the config files to change the location of the training and validation files, as well as the location of the label_map file, pretrained weights. We also need to adjust the batch size. To do so, run the following:
```
python edit_config.py --train_dir /home/workspace/data/train/ --eval_dir /home/workspace/data/val/ --batch_size 4 --checkpoint ./training/pretrained-models/ssd_resnet50_v1_fpn_640x640_coco17_tpu-8/checkpoint/ckpt-0 --label_map label_map.pbtxt
```
A new config file has been created, `pipeline_new.config`.

### Training

You will now launch your very first experiment with the Tensorflow object detection API. Create a folder `training/reference`. Move the `pipeline_new.config` to this folder. You will now have to launch two processes: 
* a training process:
```
python model_main_tf2.py --model_dir=training/reference/ --pipeline_config_path=training/reference/pipeline_new.config
```
* an evaluation process:
```
python model_main_tf2.py --model_dir=training/reference/ --pipeline_config_path=training/reference/pipeline_new.config --checkpoint_dir=training/reference/
```

NOTE: both processes will display some Tensorflow warnings.

To monitor the training, you can launch a tensorboard instance by running `tensorboard --logdir=training`. You will report your findings in the writeup. 

### Improve the performances

Most likely, this initial experiment did not yield optimal results. However, you can make multiple changes to the config file to improve this model. One obvious change consists in improving the data augmentation strategy. The [`preprocessor.proto`](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/protos/preprocessor.proto) file contains the different data augmentation method available in the Tf Object Detection API. To help you visualize these augmentations, we are providing a notebook: `Explore augmentations.ipynb`. Using this notebook, try different data augmentation combinations and select the one you think is optimal for our dataset. Justify your choices in the writeup. 

Keep in mind that the following are also available:
* experiment with the optimizer: type of optimizer, learning rate, scheduler etc
* experiment with the architecture. The Tf Object Detection API [model zoo](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/tf2_detection_zoo.md) offers many architectures. Keep in mind that the `pipeline.config` file is unique for each architecture and you will have to edit it. 


### Creating an animation
#### Export the trained model
Modify the arguments of the following function to adjust it to your models:
```
python .\exporter_main_v2.py --input_type image_tensor --pipeline_config_path training/experiment0/pipeline.config --trained_checkpoint_dir training/experiment0/ckpt-50 --output_directory training/experiment0/exported_model/
```

Finally, you can create a video of your model's inferences for any tf record file. To do so, run the following command (modify it to your files):
```
python inference_video.py -labelmap_path label_map.pbtxt --model_path training/experiment0/exported_model/saved_model --tf_record_path /home/workspace/data/test/tf.record --config_path training/experiment0/pipeline_new.config --output_path animation.mp4
```
